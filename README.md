Metaverse Search Protocol - Python-based tools for generating crossovers

This specific example contains a limited dataset of over 500 company logos. \
Not all of the company logos are present in the dataset and those missing can be added. \
The current dataset is there only to evaluate the usefulness of this crossover generator tool.

A crossover in this context is simply 2 randomly selected logos multiplied together. \
The wider meaning of a crossover can vary greatly, but ideally leads to innovative new ideas \
combining the strengths (and weaknesses) of the two or more selected universes.

The `search` tools were added and customised initially to check if a logo had already been added or not. \
There may be other potential uses and optimisations for the search tool. \
The `cross` tool was added to make selecting 2 random logos and combining them together easier to do. \
It may also have a variety of potential uses and added features that have yet to be written.

## Notes

The following ideas brought this repository into existence and are largely based on subtractive synthesis:

```
 * Start by adding .png images of every logo identity you can think of and keep adding to the dataset
 * Filter out certain images by either randomly or deliberately selecting them based on a pattern/distribution
 * Extrapolate and Analyse the contents and meanings of each selected image (perhaps also included in metadata)
 * Combine certain features of one selection with those of another to form a new overlapping idea (or "crossover")
 * Evaluate the new selection based on logical criteria derived from personal, ethical and human values
 * Make a decision on whether or not to take the new idea forward to be further refined or made into a product.
```

## WARNING: This tool is potentially very powerful. Please use it with care.
